Dear [REP NAME],

I am writting to you today to express my concern of the lack of clean water stations in my district.

Clean freshwater is an essential ingredient for a healthy human life.
Drinking water fountains serve fresh, potable water around the city. These fountains should be better maintained by the City and Park Board.

I want to continue supporting the [REP PARTY] but will only do so if some concrete action is made in moving towards more clean water stations around the city.

I appreciate your help and ask that you please send me a response letting me know if you are able to pass a Bill that would help this cause.

Thank you for your time and considering my request.

Sincerely,
[SENDER NAME]
