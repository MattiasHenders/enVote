Dear [REP NAME],

I am writting to you today to express my concern of the distinct lack of electric charging ports for electric vehicles.

EVs have better acceleration than gas cars. That's because electric motors deliver full torque right away, unlike internal combustion engines that need to gear up.
Electric motors are an incredibly efficient and durable technology, meaning less maintenance and a longer life time than gas engines.

I want to continue supporting the [REP PARTY] but will only do so if some concrete action is made towards a budget for electric vehicle charging.

I appreciate your help and ask that you please send me a response letting me know if you are able to pass a Bill that would help this cause.

Thank you for your time and considering my request.

Sincerely,
[SENDER NAME]
