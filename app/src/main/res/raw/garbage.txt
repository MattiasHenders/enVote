Dear [REP NAME],

I am writing to you today to express my concern of the lack of garbage collection in my district.

Negative effects of improper waste management not only ends in a disgusting view but also affects the overall economy of a country. State has to spend a lot of money to counter the effects of improper waste management.
Moreover, animals depended on the environment also face a great threat due to the oil spills and leaching of chemicals which directly cause soil and water contamination.

I want to continue supporting the [REP PARTY] but will only do so if some concrete action is made in the direction of better garbage collection.

I appreciate your help and ask that you please send me a response letting me know if you are able to pass a Bill that would help this cause.

Thank you for your time and considering my request.

Sincerely,
[SENDER NAME]
