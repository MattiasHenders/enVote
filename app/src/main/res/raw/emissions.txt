Dear [REP NAME],

I am writing to you today to express my concern of the distinct lack of bills regarding emissions in our area.

Gases that trap heat in the atmosphere are called greenhouse gases. This section provides information on emissions and
removals of the main greenhouse gases to and from the atmosphere.
I want to continue supporting the [REP PARTY] but will only do so if some concrete action is made towards a budget for lowering emissions.

I appreciate your help and ask that you please send me a response letting me know if you are able to pass a Bill that would help this cause.

Thank you for your time and considering my request.

Sincerely,
[SENDER NAME]
