Dear [REP NAME],

I am writing to you today to express my concern of the decline of air quality in my district.

Decreased air quality introduces a number of health risks and concerns.
Ground-level ozone (a key component of smog) is associated with many health problems, including diminished lung function, increased hospital admissions and emergency department visits for asthma, and increases in premature deaths.

I want to continue supporting the [REP PARTY] but will only do so if some concrete action is made in cleaning up our air quality.

I appreciate your help and ask that you please send me a response letting me know if you are able to pass a Bill that would help this cause.

Thank you for your time and considering my request.

Sincerely,
[SENDER NAME]
